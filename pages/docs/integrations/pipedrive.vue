        to see the technology stacks of your leads without leaving your CRM.
      </p>

      <p>
        When installed, a panel is added to the sidebar on people and
        organisations in Pipedrive showing the technologies on used on their
        website.
      </p>

      <v-alert :icon="mdiLightbulbOnOutline" type="info" class="my-8" text>
        Pipedrive fetches technology data from Wappalyzer every time you view a
        person or organisation. When you uninstall the Wappalyzer app, this
        information is longer available.
      </v-alert>

      You can also permanently enrich all organisation records at once with a
      sync, and automatically update new records using a webhook. This
      information is yours to keep and can be used to create custom reports in
      Pipedrive.

      <p>
        For people, Wappalyzer uses the persons's email address to determine the
        website domain and show the technologies in use for that website.
      </p>

      <p>
        For Wappalyzer data to show up on organisations in Pipedrive, you must
        first specify which custom field is used to store the organisation's
        website.
      </p>

      <p>
        In Pipedrive settings, go to
        <v-chip small label outlined> Data fields </v-chip>
        &rarr; <v-chip small label outlined> Organization </v-chip> &rarr;
        <v-chip small label outlined> Custom fields </v-chip> and create or find
        a custom field that contains the website URL for organisations.
      </p>

      <p>
        Select the field on the
        <nuxt-link to="/integrations/pipedrive/"
          >Pipedrive integration page</nuxt-link
        >
        in your account.

        Permanently enriched records cost 1 credit each. Records can be enriched
