      <h2 class="text-h2 mt-8 mb-2">Email deliverability explained</h2>

      <p>
        Email deliverability is simply the rate in which an outgoing email is
        delivered to the recipient's primary inbox of their email address. An
        important factor of email deliverability is the domain's reputation. A
        bad reputation can drastically affect a user's email deliverability and
        send those outgoing messages straight to the recipient's spam folder.
      </p>

      <p>
        Email deliverability is extremely important for email marketers who use
        cold email to generate sales. A high email deliverability rate means
        that their cold email outreach campaigns are successfully delivering to
        their target customers. A low email deliverability rate means that those
        cold emails are being sent to recipients, but ending up in the spam
        folder. If an outgoing cold email lands in the recipient's spam folder,
        the email reputation, open rate, CTR, and engagement rates all go down.
      </p>

        How to prepare your inbox for email deliverability
      </h2>

      <p>
        Preparing your inbox for good email deliverability can be a daunting
        task. To make the process as easy as possible, we are going to break
        down the steps for you. Here are some of the most important factors to
        keep in mind when preparing your inbox for email deliverability.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-h2 mt-8 mb-2">
        Warm up your domain for email deliverability
      </h2>

      <h3 class="text-h3 mb-2">How inbox warming works:</h3>

      <p>
        The process of warming up a domain is when a network of inboxes
        communicate with each other automatically using high quality content in
        the emails. The emails sent and received are replied to, favorited, and
        moved to folders to show positive email engagement on the domain.
        Warming up a domain can greatly benefit a user who plans to engage in
        cold email outreach campaigns.
      </p>

      <p>
        When a domain is consistently warmed up, the internet service providers
        and email service providers recognize that domain as healthy, active,
        and in good standing. By preparing your inbox for email deliverability
        by warming up the domain, users are avoiding being marked as spam,
        becoming deactivated, or worse, ending up on a blacklist.
      </p>

      <p>
        Using an email regularly is expected by ISPs and ESPs, so adding an
        extra layer of reputation can be beneficial to your domain. As the
        domain ages, high deliverability metrics can be hard to maintain. The
        health of domains can slowly decline when there is a lack of consistent
        positive engagement.
      </p>

      <p>
        By utilizing
        <a href="https://www.warmupinbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
          >Warmup Inbox</a
        >, users can find their email deliverability rates and domain reputation
        increasing, while their likelihood of being marked as spam or landing on
        a blacklist significantly decreases.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-h2 mt-8 mb-2">
        Set Up SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records for email deliverability
      </h2>

      <p>
        Setting up SPF, DKIM, and DMARC for your domain can significantly
        increase email deliverability. This will show ISPs and ESPs that your
        domain is authentic and free from any spammers attempting to send emails
        from your domain (otherwise known as spoofing). Spoofing has become
        popular among spammers, so setting up the SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records
        are very important.
      </p>

              rel="noopener"
              >SPF</a
            >
            stands for Sender Policy Framework. SPF is a layer of protection in
            terms of authentication and can prevent spammers from sending
            malicious emails from your domain.

              >DKIM</a
            >
            stands for DomainKeys Identified Mail. DKIM is another layer of
            protection in terms of authentication where mail servers are allowed
            to verify that the specific message in question was sent from a
            related email address.

              >DMARC</a
            >
            stands for Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting &amp;
            Conformance. DMARC is a protocol that determines how authentic
            incoming and outgoing emails are from a domain.

      <h2 class="text-h2 mt-8 mb-2">
        Maintain good reputations for email deliverability
      </h2>

      <p>
        Having a good reputation is like hitting the jackpot when it comes to
        how ISPs and ESPs view your domain. Making one wrong decision during an
        email outreach campaign can significantly harm your reputation, not to
        mention the campaign itself. There are four important reputations you'll
        need to protect at all times in order to prepare your inbox for email
        deliverability: IP reputation, domain reputation, content reputation,
        and inbox reputation.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-h2 mt-8 mb-2">IP reputation</h2>

      <h3 class="text-h3 mb-2">Definition</h3>

      <p>
        Simply put, IP reputation is the most important factor for
        deliverability under a domain. The IP history is heavily reviewed when
        an ESP is trying to determine if the message is safe or not.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-h3 mt-8 mb-2">How to maintain</h3>

      <p>
        Maintain your IP reputation by building highly targeted
        <nuxt-link to="/lists/">lead lists</nuxt-link> with good quality
        recipients. Your message should relevant to those who receive it.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-h3 mt-8 mb-2">How to avoid a bad IP reputation</h3>

      <p>
        Avoid email bounces at all costs. Be sure you are sending your email to
        the right contact and that there aren't any typos before hitting send.
        When an email bounces, your IP Reputation is significantly impacted.
      </p>

      <p>
        Always
        <nuxt-link to="/verify/">verify email addresses</nuxt-link> before
        sending to ensure inboxes are active and open to receive messages.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-h2 mt-8 mb-2">Domain reputation</h2>

      <h3 class="text-h3 mb-2">Definition</h3>

      <p>
        Domain reputation is the score that ESPs give a specific domain, not the
        IP Address. The score is on a scale of zero to one hundred, with one
        hundred being the goal. The better your domain reputation, the more
        trustworthy you appear to ESPs.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-h3 mt-8 mb-2">How to maintain</h3>

      <p>
        Domain reputation can be impacted by a number of factors after you've
        sent a cold email outreach campaign. To maintain a high domain
        reputation, work on the quality of your email message and who you are
        sending to. Having a high open rate, reply rate, and read rate can all
        significantly increase your domain reputation. That is why it's so
        important to narrow down a great lead list before firing off any
        outreach efforts.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-h3 mt-8 mb-2">How to avoid a bad domain reputation</h3>

      <p>
        Avoid a bad domain reputation by checking the recipients before sending.
        <a
          href="https://www.warmupinbox.com/soft-hard-bounce"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
        >
          Hard bounces</a
        >
        can plummet your domain reputation, so make sure the email you are
        attempting to reach is typed in correctly and active. Another way to
        damage your domain reputation is being marked as spam. Again, make sure
        you are only contacting those who want to read what you're sending.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-h2 mt-8 mb-2">Content reputation</h2>

      <h3 class="text-h3 mb-2">Definition</h3>

      <p>
        Content reputation is the score given after ESPs and ISPs scan your
        message and determine if you are malicious or not. Always remember, the
        contents of a message matter. ESPs and ISPs look at the type of language
        used, whether there are links or attachments, and the amount of
        characters in an email message.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-h3 mt-8 mb-2">How to maintain</h3>

      <p>
        Only include one link if possible. The more links, the more problems
        when it comes to spam filters. Also, watch your content length. Always
        stick to 500 characters or less to slide through the spam filters with
        no problems.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-h3 mt-8 mb-2">How to avoid a bad content reputation</h3>

      <p>
        Be sure to avoid using spammy words that could trigger a spam filter to
        throw your message into spam. A few examples of spammy words are "free",
        "Act now", "Password", and "Direct Funds", "$$$". You can find a much
        longer list

          here</a
        >.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-h2 mt-8 mb-2">Inbox reputation</h2>

      <h3 class="text-h3 mb-2">Definition</h3>

      <p>
        Inbox reputation evaluates who a user is reaching out to, the reputation
        of that email domain, the sending volume, the contents of the message,
        and the level of engagement.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-h3 mt-8 mb-2">How to maintain</h3>

      <p>
        Maintain your inbox reputation by only performing cold email outreach on
        quality email addresses. When doing so, be sure to include quality
        content that the recipient will want to read. Another way to maintain
        your Inbox Reputation is to regularly use your email address to maintain
        positive engagement levels.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-h3 mt-8 mb-2">How to avoid a bad inbox reputation</h3>

      <p>
        Avoid sending cold emails to unfit buyers who may mark your message as
        spam as this can be detrimental to your inbox reputation. Also avoid
        coming off as spam at all times. Be sure to watch for the amount of
        spam-like words that may be in your message.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-h2 mt-8 mb-2">
        Set up an avatar for email deliverability
      </h2>

      <p>
        Adding authenticity to your cold email outreach campaigns is crucial in
        today's world. With social media's popularity, many people are used to
        matching a face to a name. As a result, setting up an avatar is a great
        way to authenticate yourself with the recipient and create a sense of
        familiarity.
